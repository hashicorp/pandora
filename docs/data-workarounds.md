## Guide: Adding a Data Workaround 

When generating `api-definitions`, unexpected behavior can occur that requires a data workaround to be added. This can be because a type is not what we expect, attributes like `Computed` need to be added, or whole attributes need to be hand defined.

These data workarounds live in `/tools/importer-rest-api-specs/internal/components/apidefinitions/parser/dataworkarounds` and this guide will walk through how to add a new one.

## Open an issue on github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/issues 

If there is an issue with the Rest API Spec, open an issue on [Azure/azure-rest-api-specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) as the issue number will be referenced in the workaround as well as the filename to help keep track of data issues that we come across.

## Create a new workaround in `/tools/importer-rest-api-specs/internal/components/apidefinitions/parser/dataworkarounds`

The file should be called `workaround_servicepackage_{issue#}.go`. For this example, we're going to add a workaround for the issue [#31682](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/issues/31682), where we're unmarshalling the Parameter Value incorrectly and receiving `Error: occurred unmarshalling JSON - Error = 'json: cannot unmarshal bool into Go struct field` in the provider.

We'll start by creating a file called `workaround_web_31682.go`

The following is boilerplate code where we reference the issue number that this workaround applies to for added context. We also specify the service name and API version that the workaround is valid for.
```
var _ workaround = workaroundWeb31682{}

type workaroundWeb31682 struct {
}

// This checks that this workaround will only apply to a specific service/api version
func (workaroundWeb31682) IsApplicable(serviceName string, apiVersion sdkModels.APIVersion) bool {
	return serviceName == "Web" && apiVersion.APIVersion == "2016-06-01"
}

func (workaroundWeb31682) Name() string {
	return "Web / 31682"
}
```

Now we can get into the meat and potatoes of how to override this specific issue. 


First, we need to find where this information is incorrect in our `api-definitions` folder. 
Begin by navigating to the folder that contains the API definition files for the `Web` service and API version `2016-06-01`. In there we can search for the `ParameterValue` model which should pinpoint the file that needs to be modified. In this case https://github.com/hashicorp/pandora/blob/main/api-definitions/resource-manager/Web/2016-06-01/Connections/Model-ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties.json holds the `ParameterValue` Models that we're looking for.

We're seeing this issue in the following models, `CustomParameterValues`, `NonSecretParameterValues`, and `ParameterValues`. The Azure API accepts any type but the way it's been defined in our `api-definition`, it only accepts strings. We can see that by looking at the [CustomParameterValues model](https://github.com/hashicorp/pandora/blob/main/api-definitions/resource-manager/Web/2016-06-01/Connections/Model-ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties.json#L54)

```
{
  "containsDiscriminatedTypeValue": false,
  "jsonName": "customParameterValues",
  "name": "CustomParameterValues",
  "objectDefinition": {
    "type": "Dictionary",
    "nullable": false,
    "referenceName": null,
    "referenceNameIsCommonType": null,
    "nestedItem": {
      "type": "String", // this piece is correct and should be `RawObject`
      "nullable": false,
      "referenceName": null,
      "referenceNameIsCommonType": null
    }
  },
  "optional": true,
  "readOnly": false,
  "required": false,
  "sensitive": false
},
```

There is a lot in that model but we're only focused on the piece that is wrong which is in the `nestedItem` block where the `type` is `String` and it should be `RawObject`.

Now that we know where our issue is, we can build out the `Process` method in the workaround file that we created earlier that will overwrite that property with the correct information.

The normal route that most overrides go is finding the resource, then the model, then the field.

We'll start with finding the resource:

```
// At the time this function is called, we know we have the information about the specific service and api version that we want to override.
// From the top level `api-definitions` folder, our `input` is the information contained in `api-definitions/resource-manager/Web/2016-06-01`
func (workaroundWeb31682) Process(input sdkModels.APIVersion) (*sdkModels.APIVersion, error) {
    // And then we need to grab the resource we want to override which for this issue is `Connections` or `api-definitions/resource-manager/Web/2016-06-01/Connections`
	resource, ok := input.Resources["Connections"]
	if !ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("expected a Resource named `Connections` but didn't get one")
	}
	...
```

Once we've grabbed the Connections resource, we have to work our way to the specific model we want to change. For this issue, the file we want to override is [Model-ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties.json](https://github.com/hashicorp/pandora/blob/main/api-definitions/resource-manager/Web/2016-06-01/Connections/Model-ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties.json) which has the JSON name [ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties](https://github.com/hashicorp/pandora/blob/main/api-definitions/resource-manager/Web/2016-06-01/Connections/Model-ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties.json#L2). 

```
    ...
    model, ok := resource.Models["ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties"]
	if !ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("couldn't find Model `ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties`")
	}
    ...
```

After we've obtained the model, we need to grab the field and update it. The field we're trying to override for this issue is [CustomParameterValues](https://github.com/hashicorp/pandora/blob/main/api-definitions/resource-manager/Web/2016-06-01/Connections/Model-ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties.json#L54)

```
    ...
    cpvField, ok := model.Fields["CustomParameterValues"]
	if !ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("couldn't find the field `CustomParameterValues` within model `ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties`")
	}
	
	// Once we've grabbed the field, we can navigate to the incorrect piece and fix it
	if cpvField.ObjectDefinition.NestedItem != nil {
		cpvField.ObjectDefinition.NestedItem.Type = "RawObject"
	}
	...
```

Once we've overridden the incorrect field, we need to apply those changes back to all the models we touched like so:

```
    ...
    model.Fields["CustomParameterValues"] = cpvField
	resource.Models["ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties"] = model
	input.Resources["Connections"] = resource

	return &input, nil
}
```

The final Process method with all three fields changed looks like: 

```
func (workaroundWeb31682) Process(input sdkModels.APIVersion) (*sdkModels.APIVersion, error) {
	resource, ok := input.Resources["Connections"]
	if !ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("expected a Resource named `Connections` but didn't get one")
	}
	model, ok := resource.Models["ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties"]
	if !ok {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("couldn't find Model `ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties`")
	}
	fields := []string{
		"CustomParameterValues",
		"NonSecretParameterValues",
		"ParameterValues",
	}

	for _, field := range fields {
		f, ok := model.Fields[field]
		if !ok {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("couldn't find the field `%s` in model `ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties`", field)
		}
		if f.ObjectDefinition.NestedItem != nil {
			f.ObjectDefinition.NestedItem.Type = "RawObject"
		}

		model.Fields[field] = f
	}
	
	resource.Models["ApiConnectionDefinitionProperties"] = model
	input.Resources["Connections"] = resource

	return &input, nil
}
```

Finally, we want to update `/tools/importer-rest-api-specs/internal/components/apidefinitions/parser/dataworkarounds/workarounds.go` with our workaround

```
// Add the workaround to the following list
var workarounds = []workaround{
    ...
	workaroundWeb31682{},
    ...
```

To confirm the override works as intended run `make import` from `tools/importer-rest-api-specs` and confirm the model has changed.

When opening the Pull Request for this override, don't commit any changes made to `api-definitions` as we have automated processes that will apply those overrides for us.
