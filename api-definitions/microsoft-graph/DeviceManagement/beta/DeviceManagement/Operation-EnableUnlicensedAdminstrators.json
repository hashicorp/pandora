You are limited to 350 unlicensed direct members for each AAD security group in a role assignment, but you can assign multiple AAD security groups to a role if you need to support more than 350 unlicensed administrators. Licensed administrators will continue to function as-is in that transitive memberships apply and are not subject to the 350 member limit.",
