Each RoleDefinition outlines a set of permissions that determine the actions an admin or user can perform in the Intune environment. These permissions can include actions like reading or writing to specific resources, managing device configurations, deploying policies, or handling user data. RoleDefinitions are critical for enforcing role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring that administrators can only interact with the features and data relevant to their responsibilities. RoleDefinitions in Intune can either be built-in roles provided by Microsoft or custom roles created by an organization to tailor access based on specific needs. These definitions are referenced when assigning roles to users or groups, effectively controlling the scope of their administrative privileges. The collection of RoleDefinitions is managed through the Intune console or the Graph API, allowing for scalable role management across large environments. This property is read-only.",
