Alternatively, this URL can be used with compatible DASH or HLS players by appending the following to the base URL:\r\n\r\n  - HLSv4:     /manifest(format=m3u8-aapl).m3u8\r\n  - HLS CMAF:  /manifest(format=m3u8-cmaf)\r\n  - DASH CMAF: /manifest(format=mpd-time-cmaf)\r\n\r\nMoreover, an ongoing video recording can be played in \"live mode\" with latencies which are approximately double of the chosen video segment length."
