   "description": "Name of the API. The name of the operation being performed on this particular object. It should match the action name that appears in RBAC / the event service. Examples of operations include: * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/capture/action * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/restart/action * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/write * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/read * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/delete Each action should include, in order: (1) Resource Provider Namespace (2) Type hierarchy for which the action applies (e.g. server/databases for a SQL Azure database) (3) Read, Write, Action or Delete indicating which type applies. If it is a PUT/PATCH on a collection or named value, Write should be used. If it is a GET, Read should be used. If it is a DELETE, Delete should be used. If it is a POST, Action should be used. As a note: all resource providers would need to include the \"{Resource Provider Namespace}/register/action\" operation in their response. This API is used to register for their service, and should include details about the operation (e.g. a localized name for the resource provider + any special considerations like PII release)."
