At the meantime, all other public IP networks are blocked by the firewall. These restriction rules are applied only when the 'publicNetworkAccess' of the search service is 'enabled'; otherwise, traffic over public interface is not allowed even with any public IP rules, and private endpoint connections would be the exclusive access method."
