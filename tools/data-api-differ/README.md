## Tool: `data-api-differ`

This tool takes two sets of API Definitions and diffs them in several ways:

1. Detects any Breaking Changes between the two sets of API Definitions.
2. Detects any Breaking and Non-Breaking Changes between the two sets of API Definitions.
3. Detects any new Resource ID Segments containing any new Static Identifiers which need to be reviewed (e.g. the fixed value associated with a Resource Provider or Static Resource ID Segment).

These are available as three sub-commands and are described below.

### Example Usage

```
$ ./data-api-differ
2023-12-07T12:16:15.106+0100 [INFO]  Data API Differ launched..
Usage: data-api-differ [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]

Available commands are:
    detect-breaking-changes        Retrieves two sets of API Definitions from the Data API and determines if there are any breaking changes
    detect-changes                 Detects any changes between the existing and updated set of API Definitions
    output-resource-id-segments    Determines the new Resource IDs and then outputs a unique, sorted list of Static Identifiers found in the Resource ID Segments for review.
```

Specific examples for each command can be found below.

### Supported Arguments

All the subcommands support the same set of arguments:

* (Required) `--initial-path` specifies the path to the directory containing the initial/existing set of API Definitions.
* (Required) `--updated-path` specifies the path to the directory containing the updated set of API Definitions.
* (Optional) `--data-api-binary-path` specifies the path to the Data API (V2) binary. If unspecified, it's assumed this exists on the PATH (e.g. sourced from `$GOPATH/bin`).
* (Optional) `--output-file-path` specifies the path where the result should be output to. If unspecified, this is output to the terminal.

Logging can be configured using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (e.g. `LOG_LEVEL=trace`).

### Example Usage: Detecting Breaking Changes

This command detects both Breaking Changes that exist between the two sets of API Definitions.

Command:

```
$ go build . && ./data-api-differ detect-breaking-changes --initial-path=/path/to/initial-api-definitions --updated-path=/path/to/updated-api-definitions
```

This command supports each of the arguments defined under `Supported Arguments` above.

### Example Usage: Outputting the list of new Static Identifiers found within any new Resource IDs

This command detects any new Resource IDs or Resource ID Segments which are new/have been updated between the two sets of API Definitions, identifies any Static Identifiers (e.g. the Fixed Value for a Resource Provider or Static Resource ID Segment) and then outputs a unique, sorted list of these for review.

Command:

```
$ go build . && ./data-api-differ output-resource-id-segments --initial-path=/path/to/initial-api-definitions --updated-path=/path/to/updated-api-definitions
```

This command supports each of the arguments defined under `Supported Arguments` above.
